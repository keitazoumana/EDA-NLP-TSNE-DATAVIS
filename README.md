# Topics: Exploratory Data Analysis - Natural Language Processing - TSNE Visualization  

This topic gives a good understanding of the following aspects  

 **1. Exploratory Data Analysis**    
This part will cover the univariate analysis using :    

 - Barplots   
 - Picharts   
 - Boxplots   
 - Probability Density Function (PDF)   
 - Cumulative Density Function (CDF)   
 - Violinplots   

 **2. Natural Language Processing**   
 This part will cover the aspects regarding:   
 - Text processing   
	 > "decontraction" of text. Example won't ==> will not; can't ==> can not, etcetera.   
	 > Special character removal   
	 > Ordinal number / number conversion to text.   
 - Data vectorization   
 In this part, you will understand how to vectorize categorical / text / numerical features using different technics using pretrained model (Google model) and your own model. The technics are:    
	 > Bag of words   
	 > Tfidf   
	 > Average word to vect   
	 > Tfidf weighted word to vect   

**3. TSNE for Visualization**   
Finally, you will understand how to combine the vectors to create a sparse matrix to visualize your dataset.
